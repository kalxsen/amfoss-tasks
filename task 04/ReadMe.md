This was the task I enjoyed doing the most so far. No doubt about it.

# How I did it.
1. get the bot API from Bot Father via telegram
2. get google cloud API from google cloud
3. add required API services
4. write code for the bot in an editor
5. set up the development environment
6. run the bot on telegram
7. check for errors in code at the editor side
