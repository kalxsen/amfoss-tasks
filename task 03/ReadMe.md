# Hello World!

## My experience

Being a task built to introduce us to basics of diffrent computer languages this task was both challenging as well as a bit annoying.

## Difficulties faced

Let me be honest with you, most codes made no sense to me, absolute beginner in the feild of coding.
I only come to know about VScode a little too late but guess it's just that the good thind took a little time to reach me
Despite having vs code getting the editors,compilers etc for all these languages was hard and getting them to run was harder.

## Overall view
No matter what I say, I sure am glad that I got to print "Hello World!" is so many languages.
I know how "Hello World is the very first baby step into a coding language and I am glad I got to take that mini step and lots more into so many languages because of this task.
It also helped me weigh and learn the diffrence between syntax of so manny languages.
