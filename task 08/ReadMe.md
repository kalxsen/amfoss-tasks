# Blog on my telegram bot building journey.

Writing my blog on how to build a book recommending telegram bot was a lot of fun! 
I loved diving into the process of creating PagePal, breaking it down into easy steps, and sharing it in a way that felt like telling a story. 
It was exciting to blend coding with creativity, and I enjoyed imagining the readers building their own bots.
I hope the readers find it just as enjoyable as I did when putting it all together!

I really enjoyed making this blog. It was indeed a campfire like feeling. I liked it a lot. ٩(^ᗜ^ )و ´-
