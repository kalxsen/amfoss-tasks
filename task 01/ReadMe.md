# Task to increase typing speed

the images show my progress with speed increasing from 1.png to 7.png

## AIM
As a someone trying to grow in the world of coding, typing speed is extremely important. In this task I had aimed to imrprove my typing speed.

## Difficulties faced if any 

* The platform that was asked to be used was monkey type. I found it annoying that the phrases made no sense so I often made mistakes while trying to read the word.
* Typing with hands in proper position was really challenging...It wil defenitly take me a while to get there...

  ## How I hope to fix it
  Through consistant practice.
