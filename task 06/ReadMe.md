# OPEN DOC

My journey documenting Neofetch involved exploring its features and improving the documentation for better clarity.
I learned the importance of accessible technical writing and how good documentation bridges the gap between code and users, making me an active contributor to the community.
It was overall a grate experiance and since it did not involve much of the pure coding part and more of writing and typing it was simpler than the rest yet just as useful and effective.
It helped me dive deeper into the open source world. It was fun.
