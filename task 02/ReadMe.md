# Terminal-Chaos

## introduction
The Terminal Chaos task was an meant to be an immersive journey designed to familiarize the participants with essential terminal and Git commands in a narrative-driven adventure.
The game, as much as I played was really fun.

## Difficulties faced if any
* echoing codes
* pushing them into terminal
are parts where I found myself stuck at times.

## overall view
Was fun for as far as I did it. 
Pretty sure it would have been fun even if I had continued. 
I liked the concept and the story like advancement of the learning process.
Really well crafted task.
